		 Born in Delhi, Virat Kohli shot into prominence as the Under-19 skipper, who led India to victory at the 2008 World Cup
		 held in Malaysia. That accolade gained him instant recognition and made him an overnight teen sensation. Soon he made
		 his ODI debut for India in Sri Lanka in August 2008 when he was thrust into the opener's role as both Virender Sehwag and 
		 Sachin Tendulkar were ruled out due to injuries. He played two important knocks - 37 in the second ODI and 54 in the 
		 fourth - both of which resulted in India winning, thereby enabling them to win the series as well. After such an impressive
		 showing, he was slightly unlucky to remain on the bench when England visited India in December 2008, as Tendulkar and Sehwag
		 had returned and the middle-order was strong and packed. </div><br>

		 While no one doubted his abilities, his rather modest Test record was something that needed to be worked on. At the end of 2015, 
		 Kohli had hundreds, but hadn't quite converted it into double tons. At the end of 2016, he had three, one each against West Indies,
		 New Zealand and England. Kohli - the Test batsman, had finally arrived. He finished the year with 1215 runs, at a whopping average 
		 of 75.93. His Test average had passed fifty for the first time in his career.

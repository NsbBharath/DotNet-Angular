		 Amongst the cleanest hitters of a cricket ball, when Yuvraj Singh first started making waves in junior and Under-19 cricket, 
		 everyone believed that a future Indian batting star had arrived. His debut, when he was not yet 19, confirmed that in spectacular 
		 fashion, as he smashed an Australian attack comprising of Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee to make 84 runs at better 
		 than a run-a-ball in the 2000 edition of the Champions Trophy. </div>
		 <div><br>
		 His electric fielding was an added asset in a team that had always been lethargic in the field. The added assurance of being in 
		 the thick of things in ODIs and knocking on the doors of Test cricket saw Yuvraj bloom. 
		 </div><br>

		 Yuvraj hit another jackpot, when he once again became the costliest player in the 2015 IPL auctions. He was bought by Delhi Daredevils 
		 for a mammoth 16 crores, but was not retained by the franchise for the 2016 season. He was named in the World T20 squad for India,
		 while Sunrisers Hyderabad bought his services, where he would play a minor but vital role in the team's victorious campaign.</div>
